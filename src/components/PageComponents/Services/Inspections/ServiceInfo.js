        A roof inspection is the professional evaluation of a licensed roofing
        contractor regarding the conditions of your roofing. Based on whether it
        will leak in the next two years or the approximate life expectancy. It
        is a visual inspection of the ceiling, eaves, facia boards, and the
        roof. After evaluation, it can be determined if the property needs
        maintenance, repair or a full replacement.

            roof certificate for $200: A roof certificate is commonly requested
            for real estate transactions. The certificate is sometimes needed
            when the property owner refinanced their home or is in the process
            of putting their property on the market. The roof certificate is a
            professional opinion by a licensed roofing contractor document
            stating that the roof is in good condition and will not leak in the
            next two years. This allows for peace of mind to the new homeowners
            or banks that are refinancing the home/mortgage.

        It is important to have these done as early as possible as they are
        often missed by home inspectors but they can be the difference between.a
        small quick job or a larger expensive one. There are many DIY projects
        and house flippers who do not perform the work properly and can cost the
        new homeowner thousands.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lots of homeowners or house flippers simply install a new roof over an
        existing one to cut cost then sell the property. Unfortunately, home
        inspectors often overlook this as they are not roofing experts and only
        inspect the new outer layer without checking what is below
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you are the owner of the property you are then responsible to fix
        these problems, which can cost thousands. When buying a new home, you
        want the peace of mind knowing that your roof was installed properly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Common practice here in San Diego is shingling over wood shakes or cedar
        shakes. This means shingles are not installed on a plywood deck, it is
        installed over a roof that has skipped sheathing
      </p>
      <p>
        Wood shakes require skipped sheathing to be installed on the roof to
        allow for the cedar shake to be well ventilated. Wood absorbs water and
        needs to be dried out. Shingles need to be installed on plywood at least
        â…œ thick. To fix this problem you would have to remove the shingles and
        the shake. There will be a lot of debris that will fall into the attic
        space and ruin your insulation with dust, wood chips and debris. So you
        also have to hire an insulation contractor to remove all debris from the
        attic and replace it with new.

        This is just one of the examples of what you can get yourself into if
        you purchase a home without a licensed roofing contract to educate you
        on your future home or investment. Although shingles can look good from
        the outside, if installed over a shake roof it can be change the price
        to replace from $15,000 job to $30,000 job.
