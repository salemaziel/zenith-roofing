                Roof repairs will allow for budgeting to replace and provide peace of mind. We repair all types of roof covering from flat to pitched. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Repairs are best when your roof is below Â¾ of its life expectancy. 
                </p>  
                <p>
                Roof life expectancy can vary widely depending on the region you live in. In San Diego county and the greater Southern California area, the average life expectancy for a new roof is approximately 30 years.
