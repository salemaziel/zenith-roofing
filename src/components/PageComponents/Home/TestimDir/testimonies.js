      "We had 5 or 6 contractors come out over a 2 year period, that gave us quotes ranging from $900 to $7000. When we finally made a decision on a company (Protecta Roofing, estimate $1500), they didn't show up on the scheduled day, then called me a week later (when it was raining) and asked if they could come out that day to do the work. We immediately hired a 2nd company (SRS Roofing, estimate $1900), who called me the day after they were scheduled to do the work, and told me that the quote was too low and that they would send me a new quote, but never did. I was ready to give up on Angie's List all together because the contractors seem so flaky. When we got Zenith out to do a quote, I was very pleased with Bryan's knowledge, explanations, timeline and quote ($1100). He got to work a couple days later (in between rain), he cleaned the roof and sealed it, and provided us with a 2 year warranty. I highly recommend Zenith for a no bull, well done job.",
